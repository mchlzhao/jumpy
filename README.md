## Introduction

This is a high school project I completed in 2017. Using [neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution), a Perceptron was successfully trained to play the [Google Chrome dinosaur game](chrome://dino/) indefinitely.

Here is the score that the neural network achieved before I killed its execution:

The game had reached maximum speed well before then, so the computer was capable of playing ad infinitum.

Game source files downloaded from [wayou](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner), with HTML and JavaScript files modified for my use.
